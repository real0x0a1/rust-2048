# 2048 Game in Rust

A simple implementation of the popular 2048 game in Rust.

## **About**

The 2048 game is a puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them, aiming to create a tile with the number 2048. This implementation uses a 4x4 grid and follows the standard rules of the game.

## **Features**

- Simple and intuitive gameplay
- 4x4 grid with numbered tiles
- Ability to move tiles up, down, left, or right
- Tiles combine when they collide with the same value
- Game ends when a tile with value 2048 is created or when there are no more possible moves
- Scorekeeping and game over detection

## **Getting Started**

To play the game, simply clone this repository and run the game using `cargo run`. You will need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.

## **Controls**

- `w`: Move tiles up
